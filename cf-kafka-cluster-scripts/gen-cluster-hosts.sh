# Generate the clusters hosts files for a AWS Cloudformation Stack.
# If no stack is given, we try to figure out out from tags of this
# instance.
#
# The assumption is that the Cloudformation Stack deploys 1 or more
# autoscaling groups.
#	BrokerNodes	(/tmp/brokers)
#	ZookeeperNodes	(/tmp/zookeepers)
#	WorkerNodes	(/tmp/workers)
#
# The complete list of hosts for this stack is saved
# to CP_HOSTS_FILE (default is /tmp/cphosts)
#
# Zookeeper nodes and Worker nodes are optional.  If no instances for
# those autoscaling groups are found, the node list will default to
# the list from /tmp/brokers.
